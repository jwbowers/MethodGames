Automated pattern discovery is changing the world. Algorithms predict our
preferences for movies and other products. And the same general methods allow
cars to drive themselves, and for our financial markets to be dominated by
trades between automated agents rather than humans. Why should we not focus
the attention of machine learners on social science problems? The
methodologists developing QCA are animated by the same general sense that
algorithms can improve on human pattern recognition. And they are surely
correct in their intuition. Yet, \citet{lucasfk2013} show that the specific
algorithms of QCA (and variants) fail to discover patterns that exist and may
misleadingly identify phantom patterns. Of course, most algorithms are useful
for some purpose. When should variants of QCA succeed? And when should a
researcher choose another of the many possible tools for prediction and
discovery? More generally, in a world in which new techniques for machine
learning arise daily, how should social scientists decide which to use? On
what basis should we judge a method for pattern discovery? Here is a simple
proposal.

Any useful method for pattern discovery should find true patterns much more
frequently than it finds false patterns. How would we assess the pattern
finding abilities of a method? The best option, from my point of view, would
involve a competition among scholars: One scholar would invent a true pattern
and others would be challenged to discover the known but hidden truth.
Imagine, for example, that the task would be identify which function of
possibly 100 $X$ variables predicts a binary outcome, but the truth would
involve a known function of 5 of those variables (perhaps not a linear
function of any one of them, and perhaps allowing all to interact in complex
ways). Each player would receive a dataset with some number of rows (say, 10
rows, each row representing one unit) and 100 columns (each column
representing a variable). One version of the game would restrict participants to use one
algorithm (like QCA). A second version would allow participants to choose
their own algorithm (for example, some would use random forests
\cite{breiman2001random} and others would use QCA and yet others would use an
adaptive elastic net \citet{zou2009adaptive,zou2006adaptive}). In the first
version of the competition, we would learn from the winners of the competition
about how to successfully use a given method. In the second version of the
game, we would learn about how different methods compare in their ability to
address a given problem. 

If, however, time were short, one could approximate such game by following the
lead of the burgeoning field of machine learning and of
\citet{lucasf2013}.\footnote{And excellent, and free to download, overview of
	many of the techniques of machine learning is \citet{hastie2005elements}.}
That is, we could generate our true relationship and compare the effectiveness
of different machine learners both across different versions of the truth  and
different techniques for pattern finding.
